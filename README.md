Dears,
at the first i want to thank you for give me this challenge 
because of short time in Ramadan and i really found the time for task in very hard way as i already work in other company , but its realy from my pleasure to be one of your team 

i have some notes in this task :
1- the task is not complete because the time Issue but i try to do the most important things in the task as NAvbar , sideMenu with responsive design. 
2- i focus on the most mandatory thing also beside responsive design and it is the Drag and Drop and i use in it dnd kit.
3- i do the task with MUI and its my First time to work with it in deep , as i work for more 2 years by Tailwind but i was liked to be a challenge for me.
4- you have my word that any part in this task i can do it perfectlly , and i have good experience to do that.

thank you again 
Ahmed Abdeldaiem
